## Creating a new migration

```bash
# Auto-generate migration from model changes
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of changes"

# Create empty migration
alembic revision -m "description"
```

## Running migrations

```bash
# Upgrade to latest version
alembic upgrade head

# Downgrade one revision
alembic downgrade -1

# Show current revision
alembic current

# Show migration history
alembic history
```

## Important Notes

- Always review auto-generated migrations before applying
- Test migrations in development before running in production
- Create a database backup before running migrations in production
- The DATABASE_URL environment variable overrides the alembic.ini setting
