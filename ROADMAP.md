## Parallel Tracks

Some work can happen in parallel:

### Track 1: Backend Development
- Phase 1: Security fixes
- Phase 2: API completion
- Phase 3: Testing & optimization
- Phase 4: Advanced APIs

### Track 2: Frontend Development
- Phase 1: Component library setup
- Phase 2: Core UI pages
- Phase 3: UI polish & UX improvements
- Phase 4: Advanced UI features

### Track 3: DevOps
- Phase 1: CI/CD setup
- Phase 2: Staging environment
- Phase 3: Production deployment
- Phase 4: Scaling infrastructure

## Decision Points

### After Phase 1 (Week 2)
**Decision:** Are we secure enough to continue?
- **Go:** All security issues resolved, migrations working
- **No-Go:** Address remaining critical issues

### After Phase 2 (Week 5)
**Decision:** Is the core product working end-to-end?
- **Go:** User can complete full workflow successfully
- **No-Go:** Fix critical functionality gaps

### After Phase 3 (Week 8)
**Decision:** Are we ready for production?
- **Go:** Tests pass, performance acceptable, monitoring in place
- **No-Go:** Address production-readiness gaps

### After Phase 4 (Week 12)
**Decision:** Launch or add more features?
- **Launch:** If MVP features complete and stable
- **Iterate:** If critical features missing

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items
1. **Database Migrations** - Could break existing data
   - *Mitigation:* Test on copy of production data, backup before migration

2. **Performance Issues** - Nexus calculation may be slow
   - *Mitigation:* Early load testing, caching strategy, async processing

3. **Integration Complexity** - CSV formats vary widely
   - *Mitigation:* Flexible parser, validation, error handling

4. **Security Vulnerabilities** - Multi-tenant data leakage
   - *Mitigation:* Security audit after Phase 1, penetration testing

### Medium-Risk Items
- Third-party API changes (state tax APIs)
- Scaling issues with large CSV files
- Browser compatibility issues
- Timezone handling in reports

---

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- **Backend Developer:** Full-time, all phases
- **Frontend Developer:** Full-time, phases 2-4
- **DevOps Engineer:** Part-time, phases 1 & 3
- **QA/Tester:** Part-time, phases 2-3

### Infrastructure
- **Phase 1-2:** Development environment (local Docker)
- **Phase 3:** Staging environment (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- **Phase 4:** Production environment with monitoring

### Budget Estimate
- **Infrastructure:** $200-500/month (staging + production)
